# Privacy Policy

Quick Label Timer ("the app") prioritizes the protection of your personal information.

## Data Collection and Usage

- This app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
- All data (timers, labels, etc.) is stored only on your device and is never sent to external servers.
- However, to improve app stability and track errors, the app uses Firebase Crashlytics.
  - Crashlytics collects device information (OS version, device model), app version, and crash locations.
  - The collected data is not used for personal identification and is solely for quality improvement and error handling.

## Data Retention Period

- Crash data collected via Firebase Crashlytics is retained for approximately 30 days.
- After the retention period, the data is automatically deleted.
- No other personal data is collected, and data stored locally on the device is managed solely by the user.

## Third-Party Sharing

- The app does not share or provide any personal information to external parties.

## Contact

- For privacy-related inquiries, please leave a review on the App Store or open an issue in the official open-source repository.
